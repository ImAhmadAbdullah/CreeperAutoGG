#### Suggesting a server
First if you are currently in-game, close your game and launch a new instance of the game. You will need to play the gamemode/minigame you desire to be added to the mod. After playing 1 or 2 games. Close your game and go to your [latest.log](https://minecrafthopper.net/help/guides/getting-minecraft-latest-log/).

Create an issue with the title [SERVER] - [GAMEMODE] - [VERSION].\
You will need to describe the gamemode and attach your [latest.log](https://minecrafthopper.net/help/guides/getting-minecraft-latest-log/) to the issue.
